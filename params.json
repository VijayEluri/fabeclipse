{"name":"Fabeclipse","tagline":"my eclipse plugins","body":"fabeclipse\r\n==========\r\n\r\nThis project contains eclipse plugins I develop for my pesonal use and that can hopefully be useful for others.\r\n\r\nTextEditor Grep\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nThis plugin contributes a view that allows to enter a regular expression, used to produce a grep-like output\r\n(shown in the view) of the current text editor.\r\n\r\nThe view shows the original line numbers and when the cursor is moved in the grep output, the cursor in the\r\ntext editor is moved to the matching line.\r\nAny editor that subclasses the AbstractTextEditor should be supported.\r\n\r\nThe view can optionally link to the current editor (press the double link icon in the view), in this mode\r\nthe grep is refreshed whenever an editor is activated.\r\n\r\nKey bindings:\r\n* when in an editor press CTRL+ALT+G (CMD+ALT+G) to open/activate the grep view, if text is selected, it is copied in the grep expression box and it is preselected\r\n* TAB to move from grep result to grep text box and vice versa\r\n* CTRL+F in grep result opens an incremental search box\r\n\r\ninside the search box:\r\n* ESC closes the find bar, arrow down searches forwards, arrow up backwards\r\n* search is always case insensitive and incremental (find as you type)\r\n\r\nMarketplace site: http://marketplace.eclipse.org/content/texteditor-grep\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
